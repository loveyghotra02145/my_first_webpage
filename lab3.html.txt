    <h1>Hello, World!</h1>

    <p>Hello, my name is Lovepreet Singh. I started my studies in the current academic year and I am now studying at Capilano University up to the third semester. I am enrolled in the Associate of Science program. While I have Indian origins, I moved to Canada in April of the previous year. In terms of studies, my major area of focus is web development. I have a little bit of understanding of Python programming, some knowledge of HTML, and I am familiar with how to make cheat engines. 

    In one of my classes, I initially struggled with getting very low grades and even failed. However, through hard work and commitment, I gave my best effort and earned a ‘B’ in the morning articular course. This experience taught me the value of dedication and perseverance to excel. 

    In my spare time, I enjoy working with computers, exploring both the software and hardware aspects, and learning about computer registries. I also like participating in online PUBG tournaments. When I’m not gaming, I usually go on long car trips for exploration and adventure. 

    I am fluent in Punjabi, Hindi, and English. My family consists of my parents, my sister, and me, and they have been a great support in my educational journey. Currently, I am searching for a job to gain experience and further develop myself in the field of technology.</p>
